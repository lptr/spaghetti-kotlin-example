Spaghetti Kotlin example
========================

## Running with Gradle

Run `./gradlew run` from the root directory.

## Running without Gradle

Run `./build.sh`.

## Results

In either case you should see something like this:

```text
Hello Kotlin!
This is Spaghetti 2.0-51-gcbad234 with Kotlin support!
10 + 20 = : 30
Ordinal of ALMA: 0 (something = 1)
Point { x: 10, y: 20, '$metadata$': { type: 'object' } } length = 22
Callback called with 12
```

That `Hello Kotlin!` etc. is coming from our Spaghetti code.
